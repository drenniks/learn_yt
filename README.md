# Learn yt with these notebooks!

The notebooks included in this repository will help the user learn the basics of yt and how to use yt and ytree to analyze cosmological simulations.

Start with the learn_yt notebook to learn the basics of yt and how to navigate a dataset.

The notebooks in cosmology_analysis will help you learn how to deal with merger trees and halo analysis. They should follow this order:
1. Merger trees
2. Halo finding
3. Halo analysis
4. Custom halo analysis
